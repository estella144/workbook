A carpet store needs a system to create quotes for customers' queries. The program should allow the user to enter:

* Width and length of room in metres
* Cost of carpet per square metre
* Optional delivery with a fixed cost of £20
* Optional fitting with a fixed cost of £5 per square metre
* Optional 10% sales discount (on carpet only, **not** on delivery or fitting)

The program should display:

* Sub total
* Amount of VAT charged (at 20%)
* Final total
