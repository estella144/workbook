Design and implement a program that allows the user to create the bill for a cafe. The user can enter the name and price for up to 5 items and how many were ordered. If the order is to take-out, 20% VAT is added. If the customer is a pensioner, a 10% discount is applied. The program displays an appropriate bill/receipt.
