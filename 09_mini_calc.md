# 9. Mini-Calc

Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter 2 numbers and choose a mathematical operation (+ - * /). The program calculates the result and displays the answer as a full equation (eg the user enters **4** and **10** and chooses **+**. The program displays **4 + 10 = 14**)

> [!NOTE]
> The interface does not have to look like a calculator!
