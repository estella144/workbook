[Previous Task](08_volume_and_surface_calc.md) | [Next Task](10_cafe_adder.md) | [Back to Index](00_index.md)

Design and implement a program that allows the user to enter 2 numbers and choose a mathematical operation (+ - * /). The program calculates the result and displays the answer as a full equation (eg the user enters **4** and **10** and chooses **+**. The program displays **4 + 10 = 14**)

## Testing

Use the table above to identify any issues with your program.

Why do the first 3 tests use the same numbers?

What is the purpose of the 6th text in the test plan?
